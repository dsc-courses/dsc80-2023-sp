    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",

    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-sp).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `lab.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `lab-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
