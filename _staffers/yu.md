Hi! My name is Tiffany and I am a third-year Data Science student from Warren College. Besides studying, I love dancing and playing the piano. I have tutored DSC 10 three quarters and this is my second time tutoring DSC 80. I am super excited to pass on my passion to all of you. Feel free to chat with me about anything related to data science! :)
