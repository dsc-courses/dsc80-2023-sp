Hi everyone! My name is Yujia(Joy), and Iâ€™m a third-year student double majoring in Data Science and Math&Econ. I was born and raised in China for the first fourteen years of my life, then my family moved to San Diego. While this is my third time tutoring, it's my first time tutoring DSC80. I am really excited to tutor for this class, and I am willing to provide as much help as possible to everyone in this class. I look forward to meeting you all, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
