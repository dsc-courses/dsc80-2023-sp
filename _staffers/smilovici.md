Hey everyone, I'm Costin Smilovici a 4th year Data Science major. I'm from San Francisco. This is my 3rd time tutoring for DSC 80 and its has always been a joy help students with this course. Besides doing coding on the side, one hobby I have been really getting into right now  is playing trading card games at local game stores. I'm looking forward to working with everybody this quarter so feel free to stop by my office hours for questions or to just talk!
