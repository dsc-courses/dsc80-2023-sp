Hi everyone, my name is Diego and I’m a third year Data Science major. This is my third quarter as a tutor (2 previous quarters of DSC 10) and my first time tutoring for DSC 80! Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball and exploring new places! I’m happy to help with any of your questions ranging from DSC 80 concepts, internships, or any other career or unrelated topics!
