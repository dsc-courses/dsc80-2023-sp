Hello hello! My name is Aishani and I'm a third year data science major. In my free time I enjoy eating (tomatoes), camping, rock climbing, and anything and everything outdoors. This is my first time tutoring DSC 80 and I'm super excited for it! I'm always happy to talk about data science topics, exploring careers, research, or anything else you're curious about.
