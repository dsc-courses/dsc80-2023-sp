Hey! I'm Praveen, and I'm a first-year master's student in computer science from Fremont, CA. Previously, I was a data science major here -- I took DSC 80 back in Winter 2020 -- and this year, I've been TA'ing the DSC senior capstone. In my free time, I read books from Geisel, and I've been (slowly) learning the keyboard and guitar. DSC 80 is great for learning to mess around with interesting datasets, for work or for fun, so I'm excited to see everyone in discussion and office hours for anything I can help with!
