Hi everyone! I'm Yuxin Guo, a third-year majoring in Data Science and Math-CS from China. This is my third time tutoring DSC 80, and I love DSC 80 because it covers various useful and interesting topics. Outside school, I enjoy swimming, surfing, listening to music, and playing with my catüê±. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, I look forward to meeting you all!
