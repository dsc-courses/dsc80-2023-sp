    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "* There is no manually-graded component to Project 2, so the only thing you will ever submit is `project.py`.\n",
    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code ‚Äì it only runs the public tests on Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice ‚Äì once to the \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10) and once to the \"Project 2\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `project.py` file!** The functions in the `project.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-wi).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `project-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the project, as long as they also end up in `project.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! üö®\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains larger datasets than usual. They aren't huge, but they aren't tiny. The autograder has been set to allow more memory usage than usual, but if you write inefficient code you may exhaust all of the allocated memory, causing the autograder to fail. If this happens, the autograder will say that your submission was formatted incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing efficient code is part of the project!** Be sure to submit your code to the Gradescope autograder regularly to check that it is efficient enough. If your code fails to run on the autograder due to efficiency reasons and it is past the late deadline, we will perform a \"catastrophic regrade\" by removing your inefficient code (deleting that function definition) and charging the usual cost of two slip days. This is expensive, so be sure to check that your code works with the autograder with plenty of time before the deadline!\n",

    "### Working with a Partner üëØ\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There has naturally been much interest in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, recent reports suggest that the effectiveness of vaccines ‚Äì and the Pfizer vaccine in particular ‚Äì may decrease over time. While this is true, the public perception of declining vaccine effectiveness has been affected by what is often a poor use of statistics by media outlets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the following blurb from [this article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-covid-delta-variant-booster-1.6159472) on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's website (emphasis added):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Meanwhile, Israeli health officials reported what appeared to be a waning efficacy of the vaccine, including among those who had been double vaccinated. **Data showed that of the serious cases being admitted to hospital, around 60 per cent of patients were people who had been fully vaccinated**, though most were over 60 or with underlying health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stat sounds terrible ‚Äì if you're sick in a hospital bed with COVID-19, you're actually more likely to be vaccinated than not! If you're not a data scientist, you might come away with the conclusion that the vaccine is no longer effective against serious illness, or ‚Äì even worse ‚Äì that getting the vaccine will **increase** your risk of sickness. Of course, this statistic by itself is actually meaningless. For instance, imagine a world in which 100% of people are vaccinated. Then 100% of people admitted to the hospital will be vaccinated, too! In Question 8, we will explain the theory behind **vaccine effectiveness**, a statistic that more meaningfully measures the improvement in outcomes for vaccinated individuals over unvaccinated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's load in some data. For this project, we'll work with a dataset of vaccine effectiveness in Israel through mid-summer 2021. The vaccination and hospitalization records in the dataset are real. Israel was mostly vaccinated using the Pfizer vaccine, and was one of the first places where lots of data on the Delta variant was gathered."

    "Given these six pieces of information, you can calculate the overall effectiveness, the effectiveness in young people, and the effectiveness in old people.\n",
    "\n",
    "How, you may ask? Well, to find the effectiveness in young people, you can use the effectiveness definition from [Question 8](#Question-8) ($1 - \\frac{p_V}{p_U}$) directly since you are given the probability that a young vaccinated person will be hospitalized ($p_V$, for young people) and the probability that a young unvaccinated person will be hospitalized ($p_U$, for young people). The same applies for the effectiveness in old people.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the overall effectiveness, you need to find the values of $p_V$ and $p_U$ in the overall population, given  the six arguments that `effectiveness_calculator` takes in. \n",
    "- One approach is to express all six arguments in terms of conditional probability notation and to use your knowledge of probability theory from DSC 40A. One idea to look at in particular is the law of total probability ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability), [slides from DSC 40A](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2021-fa/resources/lecture/lec14-filled.pdf)).\n",
    "- Another approach is to fix concrete numbers. \n",
    "    - For instance, assume that there are 1000 old people and 1000 young people (recall, we are operating under the assumption there are an equal number of old and young people, for simplicity).\n",
    "    - To calculate the probability that a vaccinated person is hospitalized, you need to know the _number_ of vaccinated people that are hospitalized in this hypothetical example. If you're told that 20% of young people are vaccinated and that 10% of young vaccinated people will be hospitalized, you know that $1000 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.1 = 20$ young vaccinated people will be hospitalized. \n",
    "    - If you're also told that 60% of old people are vaccinated and that 30% of old vaccinated people will be hospitalized, then you know that $1000 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 0.3 = 180$ old vaccinated people will be hospitalized.\n",
    "    - Using the above information, you know that there are $1000 \\cdot 0.2 + 1000 \\cdot 0.6 = 200 + 600 = 800$ vaccinated people total.\n",
    "    - Putting this all together, 200 of the 800 vaccinated people will be hospitalized, so the overall $p_V$ is $p_V = \\frac{200}{800} = 0.25$ in this example.\n",
    "    - You can do the same for unvaccinated people to find the overall $p_U$.\n",
    "    - Working with concrete numbers like this *is* using probability theory, just with extra steps. But it might be less abstract and easier to reason about."
